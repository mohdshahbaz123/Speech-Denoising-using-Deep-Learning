Speech Denoising Using Deep Learning

> The problem statement for the application is described as follows:
Usually, in communication systems, the received signal are polluted with noise and distortion, which are mainly caused due to channel behavior. Thus, at the receiving end, the signal may lose its information due to corruption. Thus, denoising of the received signal is essential for efficient communication in one-to-one as well as broadcast systems. 

Speech signal denoising, or noise reduction, is the removal of noise and distortions present in the signal for recovering back the original signal, free from noise. The objective is to improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the incoming speech audio. This is an important application of Digital Signal Processing, which has various uses such as in cellular phones, hearing aids, teleconferencing (has become widespread after COVID-19 pandemic) etc.

In this project, we worked using principles of Digital Signal Processing, namely, Short-Time Fourier Transform; along with exploring deep learning convolutional neural network by 1D CNN & 2D CNN 

We explored the principles and made comparisons to identify that 1D CNN outperforms 2D CNN.
